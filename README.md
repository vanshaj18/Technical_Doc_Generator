# Technical Doc Generator

Technical Doc Generator is a platform that streamlines the process of creating detailed technical documentation for GitHub repositories or websites. By simply providing a repository URL or website link, the platform automatically analyzes the codebase or site and generates comprehensive documentation. This tool is designed to save time and effort, making it easier for developers and teams to maintain high-quality, up-to-date documentation for their technical products.

## Key Features

- **Automated Documentation**: Generate technical docs for any GitHub repo or website with minimal input.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Extracts and documents APIs, components, usage examples, and more.
- **Time Saver**: Eliminates the manual, repetitive work of writing and updating documentation.
- **Supports Multiple Platforms**: Works with a variety of codebases and web technologies.

## Getting Started

You can get started in two ways:

1. **Use the Hosted Platform**  
    - Provide a GitHub repository URL or website link.
    - Let the platform analyze the source.
    - Download or view the generated technical documentation.

2. **Run Locally**  
    - Download or clone this repository.
    - Use your own APIs, models, and tokens for internal usage.
    - Follow the setup instructions in the repository to start generating documentation on your own infrastructure.

## Use Cases

- Preparing technical documentation for product launches.
- Onboarding developers with clear and structured docs.
- Creating and maintaining documentation for various purposes.
- Open source maintainers requiring detailed and up-to-date documentation.
- Projects that lack initial or comprehensive documentation.

## Limitations

- **Public Repositories Only**: Currently, the platform supports only public GitHub repositories. Private repositories are not supported.
- **Small Repositories**: The tool is optimized for smaller repositories due to API parsing limitations. Large repositories may not be fully processed.
- **API Parsing Boundaries**: The primary limitation is the cap on parsing capabilities imposed by the APIs used, which restricts the size and complexity of repositories that can be analyzed.
